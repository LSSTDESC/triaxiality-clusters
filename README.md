# triaxiality-clusters
The goal of the project is to measure triaxial trends from DESC Galaxy Cluster Simulations. Using ray-traced weak lensing maps of galaxy clusters and halo catalogs, these trends can be calculated. See the alignment of triaxial signatures with large scale structure and for accurately measuring galaxy cluster masses.
